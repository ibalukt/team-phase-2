### 1.) Project Overview
  *Coaster Crunch* is a single page web application that aims  to inform readers about the different types of roller coasters that can be found throughout the world. Team Blue built a database from scratch, utilizing resources around the web. The database is sorted through with an insertion sort. This algorithm sorts the data presented one item at a time. The database that we used consists of 508 JSON objects. These objects have 7 key value pairs that we used to generate the results that you see on this project. These value pairs are name, length, height, speed, type, park, and continent. With this database, users are visually presented multiple charts that break down different statistics, from coasters per continent, to average speed and more. 
  
  
  
### 2.)Require Components
  **Angular 4** :The backbone of *Coaster Crunch* is the [Angular 4](https://angular.io/). This web application framework allowed us to break the data set into different pieces, reducig direct code under the HTML document with templates, creating a modular design and integrating programming logic on the front end. 
  
  **Chart.js** : Every graph that you see in *Coaster Crunch* is generated through the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) API. This open, community maintained project utilizes HTML5 Canvas to intake a numbe rof parameters to present our data. Chart.js integrated seemlessly with our framework.
