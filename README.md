### 1.) Project Overview
  *Coaster Crunch* is a single page web application that aims  to inform readers about the different types of roller coasters that can be found throughout the world. Team Blue built a database from scratch, utilizing resources around the web. The database is sorted through with an insertion sort. This algorithm sorts the data presented one item at a time. The database that we used consists of 508 JSON objects. These objects have 7 key value pairs that we used to generate the results that you see on this project. These value pairs are name, length, height, speed, type, park, and continent. With this database, users are visually presented multiple charts that break down different statistics, from coasters per continent, to average speed and more. 
  
  
  
### 2.)Require Components
  **Angular 4** :The backbone of *Coaster Crunch* is the [Angular 4](https://angular.io/). This web application framework allowed us to break the data set into different pieces, reducig direct code under the HTML document with templates, creating a modular design and integrating programming logic on the front end. 
  
  **Chart.js** : Every graph that you see in *Coaster Crunch* is generated through the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) API. This open, community maintained project utilizes HTML5 Canvas to intake a numbe rof parameters to present our data. Chart.js integrated seemlessly with our framework.
    
    

### 3.) Objectives & Future Content
 The objective of *Coaster Crunch* is to provide coaster enthusiasts with a simple set of data that provides more information about their favorite thrill rides. Thanks to the data table, readers can quicklys sort through roller coasters from around the world. It is our hope that readers may use this as an inspiration to place new coasters on their "must-ride" list, or build them in coaster emulation games such as *Planet Coaster* and *Rollercoaster Tycoon*



### 4.) Dependencies 
  To run *Coaster Crunch*, select the .zip file appended with SUBMISSION. Open the coaster-crunch folder in your favorite IDE. Ensure you have Node.js installed and intialize npm with the command ```npm init``` , then install Chart.js with ```npm install chart.js --save```. Because our project utilizes angular, launch it through the command ```ng serve --open``` to run it on a local host.
